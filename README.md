# Evilution
2D Game where one attempts to thwart an ever evolving evil monster

Use W,A,S,D to move around and click the mouse button (any mouse button) to fire an arrow. Arrows fire in the direction your character is moving, so they only fire while moving.

Have Fun! Or dont.. There isn't much to this game yet...

Additional information

I started out by following the Windows Universal Applications : Win2D Development tutorials to create some generic classes and basic skeletal structure for the game.

something to note, the way im using gitbash and visual studios right now requires me to close VS before I add(stage)/commit/push, some minor commits are due to me forgetting to close VS before staging. It hasn't been a big enough problem for me to invest the time into correcting it yet....
