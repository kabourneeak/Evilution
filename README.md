# Evilution
2D Game where one attempts to thwart an ever evolving evil monster

This isn't a real readme, more of an intro to the steps taken, and thought process behind making Evilution.

I started out by following the Windows Universal Applications : Win2D Development tutorials to create some generic classes and basic skeletal structure for the game.

something to note, the way im using gitbash and visual studios right now requires me to close VS before I add(stage)/commit/push, some minor commits are due to me forgetting to close VS before staging. It hasn't been a big enough problem for me to invest the time into correcting it yet....
